## Project Feedback + Evaluation

#### Project Workflow:

  > Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Performing -**
Your user stories are nicely scoped and you did a good job of determining what would be a bronze/silver/gold feature. I like the wireframe you provided. I'm of the opinion that it's better a couple quick sketches of wireframes that can change as your app changes than making one really nice one and feeling like you have to stick to it, but that's a little bit of personal preference.

#### Technical Requirements:

  > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Performing/Excelling -**
Great job getting some of the silver/bonus features like adding your own flashcards. It's also cool that you were able to figure how to use simple constructor functions!

#### Code Quality:

  > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did > you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Performing -**
You did a great job naming things, and the used comments nicely to indicate sections of the code. As nice as the intro page is I don't think your project benefits from it. If you decided it was necessary, a similar effect could be accomplished without an additional .html file and two additional .css files. You have a lot of duplicate code between these files that doesn't need to be there. Your use of indentation and whitespace is pretty consistent throughout the project and the functions are nice and concise.


#### Creativity/Interface:

  > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Performing -**
I found the buttons and interface of the app to be pretty intuitive. You could definitely add to the styling to make the experience a little more engaging for the user.

#### Total:

**Performing -**
Overall, really great job :+1: Don't be afraid to come back and add to this as you continue to learn more, it could be a great portfolio piece. This is a nice app that you should be proud of.
